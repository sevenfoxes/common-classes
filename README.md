#what is this?
This is a branch of common-classes by tbremer that is node 6+ compliant!

##Cool?
Yes! Since the import syntax is the only thing that's missing from 6, that makes this version of common-classes that can be used in LTS support environments. This will eliminate the compile step entirely.
